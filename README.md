# react-express-boilerplate
An application to connect react with express. Here the react app is built by using webpack and babel loader instead of bootstraping using the [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) from github.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs both react and express.<br>
For this `concurrently` has been used to run both servers simultaneously.

The page will reload if you make edits because of hot reloading.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run server`

To start express server.

### `npm run client`

It moves into client directory and starts the react server.

### `npm run client-install`

To install all react dependencies
